## **How to compile VMangos for Linux Ubuntu 16.04**

**Steps:**


 1. Setup the Environment
 2. Download and Compile VMangos
 3. Import and update the database
 4. Configuration
 5. Extract the maps
 6. Run the server

## Install compilers and software environments
Change to Root user

    sudo -i
    cd ~

    sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc g++ automake git-core git autoconf make patch libmysql++-dev libtool libssl-dev grep binutils zlibc libc6 libbz2-dev cmake subversion libboost-all-dev wget tmux p7zip-full



## Download and compile ACE

    wget http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/previous_versions/ACE-6.5.0.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf ACE-6.5.0.tar.gz
    
After decompression, there will be an ACE folder called ACE_wrappers in the downloaded directory.
Set the variables

    export ACE_ROOT=/root/ACE_wrappers
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ACE_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Edit the settings file

    nano $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h

Add:

    #include "ace/config-linux.h"
Create a new file:

    nano $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU
Add:

    include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU
    INSTALL_PREFIX = /usr/local

Compile ACE:

    cd /root/ACE_wrappers
    make && make install

## Download VMangos and the Database

Clone VMangos from the Git Repository

    git clone https://github.com/vmangos/core.git
    
Clone the Database from the Git Repository

    git clone https://github.com/brotalnia/database.git

## Compile Mangos

**Pre Compile Configuration**
TBB needs to be turned off before compiling 

    cd core/
    nano CMakeLists.txt

Make sure that the TBB field is set to 1 like in the picture below.

**Compile**
Note: You can replace *opt/lh* with wherever your want the binary files to be created however you need to change the rest of the locations in the guide to match.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/lh ../
After this completes run:
   
     make && make install

## Import and update the database

Go into MYSQL and follow the steps in sequence.

    mysql -u root -p
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS realmd DEFAULT CHARSET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS characters DEFAULT CHARSET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mangos DEFAULT CHARSET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS logs DEFAULT CHARSET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    
Create a new user and authorize them. **I strongly recommend changing the name from 'mangos'.**

    create user mangos identified by 'mangos';
    grant all on realmd.* to mangos@'localhost' identified by 'mangos' with grant option; 
    grant all on characters.* to mangos@'localhost' identified by 'mangos' with grant option; 
    grant all on mangos.* to mangos@'localhost' identified by 'mangos' with grant option; 
    grant all on logs.* to mangos@'localhost' identified by 'mangos' with grant option;

**SQL Migration**

Check the major database version that is in the database folder. 
    cd database/
    ls -h

You must apply any updates since the last major database release. These updates are referred to as migrations. You will find them in sql\migrations inside the repository. For your convenience, there is a batch script that can be used to merge all migrations into a single file for each database.

    cd /root/core/sql/migrations
    ls -h

![enter image description here](https://fx.fklds.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1a3bfe50621c5c.jpg)

In this example June 8th is the earliest version so we begin from there.

**Uncompress the major database file**

    cd database/
    7z e world_full_08_june_2018.7z

**Import the data**

    cd /root/core/sql
    mysql -u mangos -p realmd < logon.sql
    mysql -u mangos -p logs < logs.sql
    mysql -u mangos -p characters < characters.sql
    mysql -u mangos -p mangos < /root/database/world_full_08_june_2018.sql


**Update the base database with migrations:**

    cd core/sql/migrations/
    chmod +x merge.sh
    ./merge.sh
    mysql -u mangos -p realmd < logon_db_updates.sql
    mysql -u mangos -p logs < logs_db_updates.sql
    mysql -u mangos -p mangos < world_db_updates.sql

## Configuration

Create the data and log folders

    cd /opt/lh
    mkdir data
    mkdir log

Edit Mangosd.conf & Realmd.conf
*Note in some cases they are named mangosd.conf.dist & realmd.conf.dist you will have to rename them.*

    Nano etc/mangosd.conf

    nano etc/realmd.conf
![
](https://fx.fklds.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/18de26ff0a25bc.jpg)


**Configure the authentication server**

You need to change the following values
**Servername** , **Server IP Address** and if you wish, change the port from 8085 but make sure to update the .conf files to match

    mysql -u root -p
    
    use realmd;
    DELETE FROM realmlist WHERE id=1;
    INSERT INTO realmlist (id, name, address, port, icon, realmflags, timezone, allowedSecurityLevel)
    VALUES ('1', 'Servername', 'Server IP Address', '8085', '1', '0', '1', '0');
    exit;

In your local WOW client folder, find the realmlist.wtf file and edit it with Notepad. The IP and PORT here are the same as the database.

    realmlist.wtfset realmlist 152.178.2.154

## Extracting Maps

Use google and find a guide.

## Running the Server

There are many ways to do this but we'll use Tmux so that you can watch what's happening on screen.

    tmux
    cd /opt/lh/bin
    ./mangosd -c ../etc/mangosd.conf

Separate tmux, first press ctrl + b then press shift + 5

Press ctrl + b then press o to switch to the other half of the screen

    cd /opt/fklserver/bin
    ./realmd -c ../etc/realmd.conf

## Add an account

In the mangosd window you can enter the following commands.

account create [username] [password]    //Create user

account set addon [username] [0 to 3]   //Set the WOW environment, default is 0

account set gmlevel [username] [0 to 3]  //User level 0 = player 1 and 2 = GM 3 = administrator

server shutdown [delay]                  //how many seconds to shut down the server
